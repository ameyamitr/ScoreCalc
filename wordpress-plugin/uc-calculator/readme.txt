== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are UC GPAs calculated? =

Our calculator follows the official University of California guidelines. It counts:
* A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0 points
* Adds honors points (maximum 8 for semester system, 12 for trimester)
* Shows both weighted and unweighted GPAs

= Are test scores still used by UC campuses? =

As of 2023, the UC system is test-blind, meaning SAT/ACT scores are not used in admissions decisions. However, our UC Chances Calculator can optionally factor in test scores for a more comprehensive assessment.

= Does the Service Hours Tracker save data? =

The basic version uses local browser storage. For data that persists across devices, contact us about the advanced version.
